Crawford - 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Horn - 
even - 1

1 - Horn lands good right, lands a lesser shot the same way min later but Bud counters with a harder counterpunch; Horn's footwork, movement unorthodox, not a just a volume thing but genuinely different
2 - Crawford still processing, Horn w/ moderate success punching after initiating grapple, Bud lands a couple good clean punches towards round's end
3 - Bud picks him apart to start the round, Horn lands good right but otherwise nothing doing, Crawford has him figured out and is also way longer
7 - Horn is a fringe contender who lucked into a belt

# rounds

1 did not expect Chavez to be so mobile, Danny's vibing w/ new trainer, Freddie looks like he feels like he's dealing with a child

3 Chavez hasn't thrown anything past 2 rounds

4 better from Chavez but still Jacobs, Danny has never been afraid to rumble

5 good right from Chavez followed by a good right back from Jacobs, surreal finish, Mickey Rourke in the corner, DAZN crew getting pelted, using the round cards to shield the post-fight interview
> I'm from Brownsville and I've never run from nothing but I'm going to duck these beer cans

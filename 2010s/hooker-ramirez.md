* even: 5

> much closer than the scorecards, great fight, every round close until the end

1 Hooker, ref misses the non-knockdown

2 Ramirez takes him to the ropes

3 very close

4 same as round 4, Ramirez head movement and offensive creativity

5 good stuff from Ramirez but Hooker landed hard in the middle

6 Ramirez cracks w/ a great L and then an amazingly predatory finish

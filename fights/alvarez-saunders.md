* loosest ring walk I've ever seen
* mariachi is the boxing version of icing other team's kicker
* they are shooting this fight in 7k

* Canelo - 1-3, 8
* Saunders - 5, 7
* close - 4, 6

* 1 - good lefts to the body from Canelo, good ring generalship from BJS, better shots from Canelo
* 2 - Canelo looks so explosive, landing, Canelo throwing the counter right uppercut
* 3 - Canelo again
* 4 - Canelo body punching from the outside the best in the sport
* 5 - Saunders lands a few
* 6 - Canelo should patent that framing jab followed by the right to the body when he's got someone on the ropes
* 7 - Canelo lands big, "like a matador waving on the crowd"

# rounds

even in rounds Berchelt is winning he's getting his jab timed by Roman's overhand R (thrown from a crouch)

Berchelt throwing well to the body

Roman w/ the heart, first to fire back in the middle of the round when he was hurt and then, after the knockdown and Berchelt standing on the ropes in celebration, to get back to his feet.

Roman just survives 7 and then comes out 8 swinging!

Berchelt has a good double L hook

Berchelt's conditioning doesn't look great

how the hell is Roman throwing in round 9

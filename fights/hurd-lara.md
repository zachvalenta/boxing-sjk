# rounds

* _1_: great commentary on Hurd's defense liability working in his favor as "an aprhodisiac...you want to keep hitting him and you stay in the pocket too long" and the strategic bind he puts fighters in by forcing them "to work too hard to win the early rounds [and keep him off]", Lara w/ sharp lead lefts but he's not moving as much as he should
* _2_: Hurd doing a good job preventing Lara from tying him up, Hurd falling for every feint from Lara, getting better at rapping Lara's right flank as he tries to escape out to his left, Hurd has poor balance, Hurd coming on in last minute of round
* _3_: Hurd's 'two hands in front of your face' guard actually works ok against Lara, who doesn't go to the body much and doesn't throw many looping punches, idk what Lara is doing just sitting on the inside letting Hurd work, Kenny Bayless to eager to break guys up, Lara is either taking the round off or hurt by the body shots or making a serious tactical mistake but whatever the reason he's moving less and fighting inside
* _4_: what a fun fight; Hurd throwing a lot of soft, probing punches, he's no mawler; Lara tough to be taking these body shots; Hurd keeping Lara from the Hopkins throw and grab game; Lara looks somewhat contempuous of Hurd
* _5_: when Hurd feints he puts himself too far off and can't throw

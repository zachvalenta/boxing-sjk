# rounds

1 great commentary on Hurd's defense liability working in his favor as "an aprhodisiac...you want to keep hitting him and you stay in the pocket too long" and the strategic bind he puts fighters in by forcing them "to work too hard to win the early rounds [and keep him off]"

2 Hurd doing a good job preventing Lara from tying him up

3 Hurd's 'two hands in front of your face' guard actually works ok against Lara, who doesn't go to the body much and doesn't throw many looping punches, idk what Lara is doing just sitting on the inside letting Hurd work

4 what a fun fight; Hurd throwing a lot of soft, probing punches; he's no mawler: Lara tough to be taking these body shots

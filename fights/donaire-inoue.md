https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/28366812/naoya-inoue-nonito-donaire-2019-fight-year-was-best-ko-round

1: Inoue jabbing to the body, good shots landed and Donaire takes them well, Donaire lands a few of his own, he's not scared

2: Inoue's left hook is great, won the round but Nonito's own left lands flush to open that cut

3: Donaire def the bigger man, Donaire more aggressive but less effective that previous two rounds (shades of chasing Rigondeux) as Inoue effective in moving behind the jab (which lands pretty sharply)

5: Donaire lands some nice rights, Inoue lands a right that staggers Donaire (who is still loading up on big lefts hooks while staggered, mind you; what a champ)

7: Donaire w/ double jab R combo working well

8: really sharp round from Donaire

9: Inoue's jab is great, big right rocks Inoue, Donaire's round for sure

10: Inoue's been hit but also pretty slick defensively, slipping the right out the side door, few big rights from Inoue at the end, Donaire shook a bit but still looking to counter

11: amazing left to the body by Inoue, wtf was the ref doing standing between them while Donaire was still on his feet (this could have cost Inoue the fight), Inoue a good man for letting Donaire trot over to the corner and curl up, Donaire really holding on _but still_ looking (and landing) that beautiful counter left, after the round Inoue just rests his forearms on the ropes looking out to the crowd and soaking it in

crazy to think Inoue won and had a bad cut and a broken nose and orbital bone to show for it

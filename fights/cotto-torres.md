# first viewing

* _Cotto_: 3-4, 6, 7
* _Torres_: 2, 5
* _even_: 1

* _1_: Cotto seriously wobbled by Torres, never seen Cotto throw wild like that
* _2_: Cotto is in serious trouble in the first couple minutes, Torres throwing from his heels, gaffe by referee to not call the push but aided bc Cotto was punch drunk, lol Lamley on 'gunfight in Atlantic City' comment, good commentary by Foreman that Cotto can't get ramped up on the counterattack bc he might not be the smarter puncher, Torres punched out
* _3_: Cotto left the body is a signature punch
* _4_: Lampley on Torres making a show of any low punch ("makes sense, evidently") an George's response ("only makes sense if you don't have any dignity"); crushing right to the body at the 2:00 mark; Cotta is chopping him down
* _6_: Foreman on what fighters need in their corner - ice in their cup, back rub, less talking

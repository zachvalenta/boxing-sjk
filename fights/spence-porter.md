# rounds

Fox announcers are terrible

3 Jack Reese lets Spence throw a some low blows, Shawn has that happy zen where he doens't seem that disturbed by them

6 by mid-fight Shawn is no longer sticking and moving and Errol is just unloading body shots, Bud would solve Spence

7 and then Shawn does move and spends the round beating Errol to the punch

11 Shawn was winning round unti he got dropped, his face on getting up was disappointed but firm

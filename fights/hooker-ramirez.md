* Hooker: 
* Ramirez: 2, 6
* even: 1, 3-5

1 good up jab from Ramirez

2 good left hook and pivot from Hooker as Ramirez dips to his left, good lefts to the body from both men, good job by Ramirez to bait Hooker into throwing the left hook so he can counter with an overhand right, clear round for Ramirez based on last minute

3 Ramirez wise to pivot off the jab bc Hooker's is very good, good body shots from Mo

4 idk how I had 3 and 4 for Ramirez, even rounds and if anything went to Hooker

5 great action, Ramirez controlling the middle minute but Hooker landing heavy stuff in final minute

6 ends that fast, Mo says a short but intimate thank you to the ref for stopping it, Hooker brought his head up with his hands down

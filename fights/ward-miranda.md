* Ward: 1, 3-
* Miranda:
* even: 2

* _1_: cut from a clash of heads, Ward switches and pulls the Loma, moving diagonally right to close space and throwing the straight right, Stitch Duran working Ward's cut
* _2_: ref (Shirley) breaking them too early, if I was Miranda; Ward controls round as a whole but Miranda lands some strong rights
* _3_: Ward great at getting out of the corner without running and sometimes even manipulating an offensive opportunity out of it
* _4_: Ward also great at controlling the head, starts to clown Miranda and break him mentally

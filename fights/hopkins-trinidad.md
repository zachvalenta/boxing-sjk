# rounds

> only comment from first time watching was that Smoger should have been warning Hopkins about holding and hitting

* _1_: Smoger, indeed, should be warning Hopkins about holding and hitting (and Tito should have a plan for it)
* _2_: good point from Foreman that "Trinidad only wants to land hard shots, nothing else", Hopkins takes the round on a good jab and the right to close the round
* _5_: better in fighting from Tito, great R off the ropes from B Hop
* _6_: George Foreman is very enamored w/ Trinidad and dismissive of Hopkins, great round
* _7_: "why don't you want to give Hopkins more credit, George?" Larry Merchant is great, Harold Lederman's little laugh when Lampley throws the mic his way is great, Hopkins effervescent in his movements and feints
* _10_: amazing round
* _12_: push from Hopkins after the shot but Trinidad was done for anyway

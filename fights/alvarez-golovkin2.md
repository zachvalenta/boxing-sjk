# rounds

2 great uppercut from Alvarez, idk what GGG hands were doing away from his face (Canelo made the same mistake later in the round on what was obviously a hook; might be a good idea to train fighters not to parry the jab with their right hand), good Canelo bodyshot slipping jab, good left hook from GGG

4 GGG stayed on him the whole time, Canelo rolled that uppercut, GGG looks sharper than first fight

5 Canelo loves that Mayweather counter R

6 both Canelo and GGG look like they're in the best shape of their lives, really good and tense round

7 _double_ uppercut from Canelo, the pace of this fight akin to lightweight or even 

8 good round from Alvarez, good foot movement from GGG, high-speed chess, announcers from British broadcast (along w/ HBO) have Golovkin up 5-3 at this point

9 Alvarez's body work is being overlooked, crazy to see Golovkin backing up and circling, wearing him down def part of Alvarez's game plan

10 GGG lands good R but announcers go overboard like Canelo is hurt (how he avoid the next 10 punches if he's hurt?), could have given the 10th to GGG

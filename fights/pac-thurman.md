# rounds

1 Thurman's round until that devilish knockdown

2 the crowd is for Pacquiao in a big way; Manny's speed is a problem for Keith; Keith's boxing acumen is a problem for Manny; Joe Goosen is surprisingly inept as an announcer, maybe this is his first time; Manny win's the bigger exchanges in this round

3 Manny's got to be one of the best at jabbing (and throwing that R hook) over a R jab; Many's better on the ropes that you'd expect, especially if a bigger fighter gets to far on top of him and negates their own reach advantage; Thurman lands a nice L to the body

6 Keith is giving him too much credit, walk his small ass down

7 sharp punching from Thurman, getting hit does not bother Manny to the point you wonder if he likes it

10 Pac catches him with a body shot, Thurman does well to stay on his feet and rally

scoring
* Prograis: 1
* Taylor: 2, 6, 9-10
* even: 3-5, 7, 11-12

rounds
* like how Regis doesn't stay in his corner
* 1 good counterpunching to the body from Prograis, Taylor picks it up but Prograis' jab keeps the round for him
* 2 Prograis punches to the body less and Taylor more, to Taylor's benefit
* 3 sky sports announcers gushing about Taylor and embarassing themselves, Prograis taking more of the center of the ring, nice left from Taylor to close
* 4 Regis pokes him with some jabs and Taylor remembers that he has one, too; nip tuck the whole round
* 5 Taylor good ring IQ of when to use his feet to get out and break Prograis' rhythm, sneaky right lead hook coming from Taylor as he wheels out of the corner (haven't seen that one before)
* 6 good body punching from Taylor to start, Prograis doesn't throw the straight L often, Prograis able to avoid the straight punches from Taylor (knows what's coming after those tapping jabs) but Taylor digging to the body, lot of good hooking shots from him this round
* 7 Taylor better about getting out before Regis bangs him to the body, Taylor in a close round
* 8 Taylor coming forward more, Prograis better defending that lead right hook, Taylor looked better the whole round but Prograis landed the hardest shot (which I think opened the cut above Taylor's eye)
* 9 great action
* 10 Prograis looks sluggish to start and much more hittable than in previous rounds, widest round for Taylor so far
* 11 sharp start from both, great action, real close
* 12 both guys almost comically ragged but so hard

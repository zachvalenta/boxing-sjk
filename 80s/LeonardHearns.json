			"Hearns 1 2 has to be up there for best all-time; the jab a definition of snap, the right a knockout punch",
			"Hearns taking the round on jabs",
			"like how the round cards at Caesar's Palace employ Roman numerals"
		],
		"6": [
			"amazing uppercut by Sugar Ray that he brought up from the floor",
			"Hearns is too proud and too angry at Leonard, should be holding but trying to knock him out and just taking damage"
		],
		"7": "Ray powerful and fluid, esp. to the body; Hearns doesn't have an answer defensively other than pushing",
		"9": ["Hearns composed, flowing, cautious but not afraid", 
			"touch gloves after the round, in a different space from the shit talking earlier"
		],
		"10": "good comment: 'as though each fighter is beginning the fight again' re: slow pace and reversal of roles "
		"11": [
			"Hearns starts coming forward for first time in 5 rounds",
			"Hearns lands two good rights and a nice left hook to the body",
			"Hearns, with a right lead and a short straightish hook up next, wins his best exchange of the fight"
		]
		"12": [
			"Hearns can throw that right to the body and not have to set up again, so long is his reach",
			"Leonard's left eye swollen"
		]
		"13": "difference between Ray and Floyd right there; what an offensive flurry"

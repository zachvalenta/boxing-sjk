other fights that I watched
* _Alvarez-Jacobs_: Jacobs 1 10 Canelo 4(d) -6 8 11 (misstep by DJ) 12 even 2 3 7 9
* _Alvarez-Kovalev_: Alvarez 6-7, 10-11 Kovalev 1-2, 8 even 3-5, 9 Mannix had this fight scored correctly, Kovalev had good ring generalship but didn't land
* _Benavidez-Dirrell_: Dirrell would have taken it w/ more movement, better ring generalship
* _Crawford-Horn_: Horn's movement unorthodox, moderate success punching after initiating grapple, Bud has him figured out by round 3
* _Crawford-Dulorme_: Dulorme not bad with the jab then right to the body in the opening few rounds, Crawford feeling great by end of round 4 but Dulorme takes the 5th before Bud catches him in the 6th
* _Garcia-Easter_: impressive that Mikey able to land the jab at such a reach disadvantage, great 9th round
* _Gvozdyk-Stevenson_: Gvozdyk 3, 6, 11 Stevenson 1-2 even 10
* _Usyk-Bellew_: like Loma, Usyk an intelligent pressure fighter
